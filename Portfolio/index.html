        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am a San Jose native, and have lived in the Silicon Valley my entire life.  I obtained my B.A. and M.A. degrees in psychology
          from San Jose State University.  Whenever possible, I tailored my coursework towards educational psychology; I have always
          loved learning, and I feel very fortunate to now be in an industry where I get to learn something new each and every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          After obtaining exposure to coding through Massive Open Online Courses, including EdX and Udacity, as well as utilizing python
          for data analysis in market research, I decided to transfer over to coding full-time. To this end, I enrolled in Coding Dojo's
          intense boot camp program, which includes 1000 hours of instruction for 3 full stacks of development within 14 weeks. The breadth
          of the curriculum ensures that students not only learn how to code in 3 stacks, but they also learn the underlying concepts behind coding
          by being able to compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each stack.
