//Swift is strongly typed, meaning variable types cannot change after creation
//Use constants for everything that doesn't vary, in which case, use variables

//var name = "Anakin"            // Type inferred as String based on the value "Anakin"
//name = 42                      // THIS IS STILL NOT ALLOWED since name is a "String" type

//// Declare name as a constant because we anticipate that it will NOT change.
//let name: String = "Anakin Skywalker"
//// Note that just like variables, constants also have types
//// Now we cannot change the name:
//name = "Darth Vader"        // THIS WON'T WORK because name is a constant so we CANNOT change it.
